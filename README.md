# Football_Prediction

The English Premier League is in full swing and it's been an interesting season for lots of teams with Arsenal back in the top 4. Here is your chance to use data points from the betting markets to predict the outcome for a match.

Please follow the instructions mentioned below to go about it:
● Download the dataset from this link
● The key to all data fields is given here
● Convert the FTR (Full Time Result Column into 1 if Away Team wins else 0)
● Use the betting market data columns to see if we can build a model to predict the
  outcome for the match based on these pre-market odds.

Things to keep in mind
● You can only use signals that are available before the match starts, so team names, away/home etc is fair to use. Any info that happens during the match is a violation.
● Use lots of exploratory analysis and graphs to get a sense for the data.
● Follow a hypothesis based approach.
Submission/Output
● Code up your solution from EDA to the final output with probabilities/graphs etc either as a R/Python file/notebook.
● Upload the file/notebook to a git repository and share the link with us.
● Points for effective storytelling and structured problem solving with
comments/explanations.
● Get creativity in terms of visualization, approaches and statistical modeling.
● Please also share a clean doc with explanation for approach and final outcome in terms
of the model used. Clearly state the what and why for the approach.
